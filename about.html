        <h2>Why Caugia exists</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Many revenue organisations work hard but operate in systems that were never intentionally designed. 
          Processes grow organically. Tools accumulate. Teams specialise. Each part functions, yet the overall engine feels heavier every quarter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these environments effort rises faster than clarity. Leadership spends more time managing complexity than shaping direction. 
          Results depend on individual heroics instead of a system that carries the organisation forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caugia was created to offer a calmer alternative. A way to read the entire revenue engine as one structure and replace scattered motion with a coherent operating model that restores clarity, alignment and control.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>The philosophy</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Strong revenue engines are built on balance.  
          Clarity emerges when four forces work together without friction.
        </p>

        <div class="about-lines">
          <p>Guidance</p>
          <p>Resources</p>
          <p>Implementation</p>
          <p>Performance</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          When these forces align, teams move with intention.  
          When they drift apart, the organisation compensates with effort.  
          Meetings expand. Priorities shift. Progress slows under the weight of good intentions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The GRIP Diamond makes this balance visible. It reveals where tension accumulates and why the system feels heavy, giving leaders a clear view of what to strengthen now and what to protect for later.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- APPROACH -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>How Caugia works</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Caugia removes noise rather than adding more of it.  
          The work begins by creating one shared model of the revenue engine.  
          This model becomes the reference point for decisions, priorities and execution across all teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the system is visible, leaders gain space to think clearly again.  
          Decisions quieten. Priorities stabilise. The organisation moves with less urgency and more coordination.  
          Energy shifts from reacting to designing.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- WHO LEADS -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>Who leads Caugia</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Caugia is led by Tom Meijer. His work focuses on one idea.  
          A revenue system should make performance predictable. It should reduce friction, not depend on pressure or speed to function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tom’s experience in modern SaaS environments shaped the principles behind Caugia.  
          Environments where growth, complexity and ambition rise together.  
          His work at Caugia turns these lessons into a calm and structured approach that strengthens organisations without overwhelming them.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>What it feels like</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Leaders often describe the experience in simple words.  
          Calm. Clear. Grounded.  
          Once the system becomes visible the organisation gains a new sense of control.  
          Noise reduces. Focus returns.  
          Teams move with a shared understanding instead of constant recalibration.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- OUTCOME -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>The outcome</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          After the first cycle the revenue engine feels different.  
          Not heavier but lighter.  
          Not busier but clearer.  
          Not more complex but more coherent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caugia does not add layers.  
          It removes friction and establishes a system that moves as one.  
          A system leaders can trust and teams can rely on.

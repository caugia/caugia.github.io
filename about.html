        <h2>Why Caugia exists</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Many SaaS companies grow fast. Teams are strong. Tools are modern. Dashboards look full. Yet the system feels heavier each quarter.  
          Leadership feels the pressure. Execution becomes reactive. And results depend on heroic effort rather than structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tom Meijer experienced this pattern in high growth environments. Everyone pushed hard, but the system around them had never been designed as one system.  
          Caugia was created to offer a calmer alternative.  
          A structured way to read the entire GTM engine and turn fragmented motion into a single, coherent operating model.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>The philosophy</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Strong revenue engines are not built on speed.  
          They are built on balance across four forces that shape every GTM system.
        </p>

        <div class="about-lines">
          <p>Guidance</p>
          <p>Resources</p>
          <p>Implementation</p>
          <p>Performance</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          When these forces align, teams operate with clarity.  
          When they tilt out of balance, the organisation compensates with effort.  
          Meetings drift. Priorities shift. People work hard without moving together.
        </p>

        <p>
          The GRIP Diamond reveals the shape of the system so leaders can see why things feel heavy and decide what truly matters now.

    <!-- APPROACH -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>How Caugia works</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Caugia does not add noise. It removes it.  
          The work begins by making the system visible.  
          Not as a slide or a dashboard, but as a shared understanding that allows leadership to slow the chaos and regain control of the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decisions become quieter.  
          Priorities become clearer.  
          Initiatives become fewer and more effective.  
          The organisation moves with confidence instead of tension.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- WHO LEADS -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>Who leads Caugia</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Caugia is led by Tom Meijer, whose work has focused on one idea.  
          A revenue system should not rely on heroics. It should create conditions where strong performance becomes the natural outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tom brings experience from modern SaaS environments where speed, pressure and complexity collide.  
          His work at Caugia distils this into a calm, structured approach that strengthens organisations without overwhelming them.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>What it feels like</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Leaders often describe the experience in similar words.  
          Calm. Clarifying. Relieving.  
          Once the system becomes visible, the organisation gains a new sense of control.  
          There is less noise. More focus.  
          And a renewed confidence in the path ahead.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- OUTCOME -->
    <section class="home-section fade-up">
      <div class="section-heading">
        <h2>The outcome</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          After the first cycle, the GTM engine feels different.  
          Not heavier but lighter.  
          Not busier but clearer.  
          Not more complex but more coherent.  
          Caugia does not add layers.  
          It removes friction and leaves a system that moves as one.

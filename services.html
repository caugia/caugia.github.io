    <div class="faq">

      <details>
        <summary>What is the difference between the GTM Score and the Intelligence Report?</summary>
        <p>
          The GTM Score is a free and lightweight diagnostic. It quantifies your GTM system and
          shows where friction sits.  
          The Intelligence Report is a deeper GRIP analysis. It reveals the constraints behind
          the score, explains why they exist and prioritises where improvement will have the
          highest return.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Who is this designed for?</summary>
        <p>
          Caugia is built for leaders who want clarity on how their revenue engine works.
          Typical users include CEOs, CROs, CMOs, Heads of GTM, Revenue Operations and
          founder-led teams.  
          The framework adapts to different stages, from early scale to enterprise.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do we need a certain level of GTM maturity?</summary>
        <p>
          No.  
          GRIP adapts to your stage and reveals the constraints that matter now.  
          Early stage companies use it to create structure.  
          Larger organisations use it to align teams, strengthen operations and remove guesswork.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How long does the process take?</summary>
        <p>
          The free GTM Score takes a few minutes.  
          The Intelligence Report is delivered on the same day.  
          Modules and advisory support are added only where they create meaningful movement
          with minimal disruption.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can we start with modules without doing the Score or the Report?</summary>
        <p>
          It is possible, but not recommended.  
          The Score and the Intelligence Report provide the context that makes each module
          more precise and prevent teams from working on symptoms rather than root causes.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How does GRIP differ from other GTM frameworks?</summary>
        <p>
          GRIP is a structured operating system for GTM.  
          It connects market reality, execution quality and organisational alignment in one model.
          Unlike channel or pipeline frameworks, GRIP evaluates the system as a whole and
          shows exactly where leverage sits.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What happens after we receive the results?</summary>
        <p>
          You receive clear recommendations, structural insights and a priority sequence.  
          Most companies then choose targeted modules or advisory support to turn those insights
          into measurable improvement.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Is this suitable for companies preparing for fundraising?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes.  
          GRIP provides a structured view of your revenue engine, strengthens your narrative
          and gives investors confidence that growth is grounded in a system rather than hope.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can this replace a traditional GTM audit?</summary>
        <p>
          In most cases, yes.  
          The combination of the GTM Score, the Intelligence Report and the modular deep-dives
          delivers the clarity leaders usually seek from an audit, but without meetings,
          interviews or consulting overhead.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you support implementation?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes.  
          Advisory support helps you apply GRIP to decisions, prioritisation and day-to-day execution.
          It gives teams structure, removes uncertainty and creates a predictable cadence
          for improvement.
        </p>
      </details>

      <!-- PRICING & PAYMENTS -->

      <details>
        <summary>Do you offer fixed pricing or time-based pricing?</summary>
        <p>
          The GTM Score is free.  
          The Intelligence Report and all modules use fixed pricing with clearly defined deliverables.  
          Advisory support can be delivered as a fixed scope or on a simple monthly cadence.  
          This gives leaders clarity and keeps the focus on outcomes rather than hours.

        <summary>How do payments work?</summary>
        <p>
          For fixed-scope work, payment is made at the start of the engagement.  
          For advisory support, billing follows a straightforward monthly structure with
          no long-term lock-in unless agreed.  
          Everything is designed to be clear, predictable and easy for your finance team to manage.

        <summary>Do we need a long-term contract?</summary>
        <p>
          No.  
          You can start with a single diagnostic or module.  
          Advisory support is offered month-to-month, with clear deliverables and a structured cadence.  
          You extend only if the work continues to deliver value.

        <summary>Can we start small and expand later?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes.  
          Most companies begin with the GTM Score and the Intelligence Report.  
          Modules and advisory support are added only where GRIP shows the highest leverage.  
          This avoids unnecessary spend and keeps improvement focused.

        <summary>Do you work with procurement and legal teams?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes.  
          Caugia provides clear scopes, structured deliverables and simple agreements.  
          This reduces review cycles and ensures compliance with procurement requirements.

      <details>
        <summary>Is there a refund or satisfaction guarantee?</summary>
        <p>
          Caugia provides fixed-scope work with clearly defined outputs.  
          If something is not delivered as agreed or a deliverable is incomplete,
          it is corrected immediately at no additional cost.  
          If a team disagrees with the insights or recommendations, that is not a basis for a refund.  
          This is standard practice in consulting and ensures a fair and predictable engagement.
